# subset basics
# a single [ returns an object of the same class of the object subset
# a double [[ is used to subset a list or a dataframe. It returns a single object not necessarily of the same class of the object subst
# a $ sign is used to subset a list or a dataframe using a name. Works similarly to the double [[
