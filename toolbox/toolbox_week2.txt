GITHUB
fork means copying an existing remote repo on your machine (the command is git clone)

to link a local repo with a remote repo type:
git remote add origin <<URL>>

git add . #adds all new files
git add -u #updates tracking for files that changed names or were deleted
git add -A #does both of the previous

git commit -m "message" #updates the local repo, not the remote repo on Github

git push #updates the remote repo

git checkout -b branchname #creates a new branch

git branch #shows the active branch

git checkout master #switch back to the master branch

biocLite() #installs basic packages
bioLite(c("GenomicFeatures", "AnnotationDbi")) #installs these packages through bioconductor
