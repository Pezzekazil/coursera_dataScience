#Week 1
##Obtaining Data Motivation
This course covers the basic ideas behind getting data ready for analysis.  
1. Finding and extracting raw data  
2. Tidy data principles  
3. Practical implementation through R  
We wish to have data in a tabular format, where one row corresponds to one observation.  
However, normally data comes in the form of text files, json, or maybe it is already structured but in multiple DBRMS.  

##Raw and processed data
Data are values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set of items.  

1. Raw data
  * Original source of data
  * Hard to use for data analysis
  * Data analysis includes processing
  * Raw data may only need to be processed once
2. Processed data
  * Data that is ready for analysis
  * Processing can include merging, subsetting, transforming
  * There may be standards for processing
  * All steps should be recorded
