#Week 1
##Obtaining Data Motivation
This course covers the basic ideas behind getting data ready for analysis.  
1. Finding and extracting raw data  
2. Tidy data principles  
3. Practical implementation through R  
We wish to have data in a tabular format, where one row corresponds to one observation.  
However, normally data comes in the form of text files, json, or maybe it is already structured but in multiple DBRMS.  

##Raw and processed data
Data are values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set of items.  
1. Raw data
  1. Original source of data
  2. Hard to use for data analysis
  3. Data analysis includes processing
  4. Raw data may only need to be processed once
2. Processed data
  1. Data that is ready for analysis
  2. Processing can include merging, subsetting, transforming
  3. There may be standards for processing
  4. All steps should be recorded
